**JAVA CHATTING TOOL**

I made a little chat tool for this project that allows client and server to talk to each other via IP addresses. I have specifically incorporated the interaction between them using Java socket programming. It applies the front end view using JavaX, an API that is a component of advanced Java. Simply run the TwoChat.java file or copy the Java code into the Java IDE and run it twice for the client and server to start the program.  To connect to the server, first run it as a server and then as a client. It only provides a brief example of how Java can be used to run applications with a graphical user interface and server programming; the main emphasis is on socket programming, which is how the real connection is made.
